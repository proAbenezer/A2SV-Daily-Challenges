# A2SV Daily Challenges

This repository contains my daily problem-solving challenges as part of my A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley) training. The challenges cover problems from LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank, focusing on data structures, algorithms, and competitive programming skills.

## Platforms

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

## How I Solve Problems

1. **Understand the problem** - Read carefully and identify constraints.
2. **Use pen and paper** - I sketch out my ideas and approach before coding.
3. **Seek help if stuck** - If the question takes me more than 10 minutes, I immediately watch a video or read an article to understand better.
4. **Plan a solution** - Choose an approach (brute force, greedy, dynamic programming, etc.).
5. **Implement** - Code the solution efficiently.
6. **Optimize** - Improve time and space complexity.
7. **Test** - Run against edge cases and validate results.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/A2SV-Daily-Challenges.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a problem folder:
   ```bash
   cd A2SV-Daily-Challenges
   ```
3. Run a solution (example for Python):
   ```bash
   python ProblemName.py
   ```
